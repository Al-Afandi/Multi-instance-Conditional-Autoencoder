Submitted to:
The 2021 International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB2021)

### Prerequisites-Installing
To run our code You need to install Python and PyTorch.

### Running our code
The repository has  many scripts implenting Multi-instance Conditional Autoencoder over two images datasets (mnist, cifar10) and two audio datasets (celebrity and Javanese).
